# Research hypothesis, its aims and goals

## Research hypothesis
The research hypothesis is formulated as follows:

```{admonition} Research hypothesis
_Anticipatory Classifiers Systems can build the correct internal model of the environment using the real-valued input signal_.
```

## Aims and goals
In order to validate the expressed hypothesis, the following goals have been formulated:

1. Propose modifications towards the ALCS system capable of handling real-valued input and optimizing overall performance.
2. Propose relevant benchmarking problems and metrics for evaluating ALCS performance.
3. Propose relevant improvements towards neoteric changes.
4. Conduct an empirical evaluation of intended adjustments.
5. Develop an open-sourced Python Machine Learning framework for evaluating various LCS algorithms.
