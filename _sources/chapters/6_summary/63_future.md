# Future Works
The ideas presented in this thesis may be potentially developed in the following directions:

- Research on compacting the created population $[P]$. The current solution evolves a set of distinct classifiers representing fine-grained niches of search space. An online process capable of merging neighbouring rules would positively impact the overall performance and transparency.
- Investigation of agent's behaviour for non-stationary and non-deterministic environments. Problems like noise perception, of _concept drifting_ where the agent has to refine population of classifiers over time.
- Utilization of specific ALCS mechanisms like _action planning_ to optimize the process of building an internal model of the real-valued environment. 
- Efficient way of tuning system parameters. ALCS comprises numerous hyper-parameters; therefore, employing a heuristic process would contribute to better performance.
