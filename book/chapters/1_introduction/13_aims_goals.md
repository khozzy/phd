# Research hypothesis, its aims and goals

## Research hypothesis
The research hypothesis is formulated as follows:

```{admonition} Research hypothesis
_Anticipatory Classifiers Systems are capable of building the correct internal model of the environment using the real-valued input signal_.
```

## Aims and goals
In order to validate the expressed hypothesis, the following goals have been formulated:
1. Propose modifications towards ALCS system capable of handling real-valued input and optimizing overall performance.
2. Propose relevant benchmarking problems and metrics for evaluating ALCS performance.
3. Conduct an experimental evaluation of proposed changes.
4. Developing an open-sourced Python Machine Learning framework for evaluating various LCS algorithms.
