# Thesis structure 
[Chapter 2](../2_selected_topics/21_introduction.md) introduces selected topics related to Learning Classifier Systems and handling of real-valued signal. The evolution of a system capable of predicting consequences of executed actions and possible testing environments are emphasized. Moreover, the experimentation process is described, including the statistical verification of obtained results and description of key performance indicators. [Chapter 3](../3_internalizing/31_introduction.md) proposes two approaches towards dealing with real-valued signal. The first one involves a novel system, representing environmental state by the interval predicates, while the other one transform signal before it is perceived by an actual algorithm.  Both [Chapter 4](../4_biased_exploration/41_introduction.md) and [Chapter 5](../5_diminishing_reward/51_introduction.md) focuses on potential problems related with the processing of real-valued data. Optimizations for more efficient process of collecting knowledge, and the problems when the reward signal requires executing multiple steps are discussed. Finally, [Chapter 6](../6_summary/61_summary.md) concludes the thesis and presents potential future research directions.
