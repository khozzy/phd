    "```{admonition} _Experiment 1 - Encoding precision_\n",
    "The impact of using different values of bits for creating UBR ranges will be contrasted with the ability of exploiting the single-step [](section-topics-environments-rmpx) environment. Due to the environment's increasing complexity a simple 3-bit variant is sufficient to demonstrate the potential pitfalls of using interval based representation\n",

    "The main goal of the experiment is to investigate the nature and the evolution of condition intervals. An experiment using the [](section-topics-environments-checkerboard) environment will highlight mainly the difference between conditional attributes but also the overall performance in this environment.\n",
