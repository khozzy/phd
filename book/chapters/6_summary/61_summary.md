# Summary
LCS are now considered as sequential decision problem-solving systems endowed with a generalization property {cite}`sigaud2007learning`. Due to the presence of often more sophisticated approaches like artificial neural networks their advantage is the capability of forming human-readable collection of rules.  

- `bacardit2006learning` good source for conclusions

- Mention why systems like XCS are not considered

- Mention that OIQ method performance is also evaluated in fixed-width bucket sizes ([](section-internalizing-experiment-3) and [](section-internalizing-experiment-4) in [publication X].

- The benefit of population readability is partially maintained by selecting the discretization and interval predicate encoding

- A good discretization algorithm has to balance the loss of information intrinsic to this kind of process and generating a reasonable number of cut  points, that is, a reasonable search space.

- the effect part of classifier was not affected

- Model free - limited assumptions about the environment [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-free_(reinforcement_learning))
