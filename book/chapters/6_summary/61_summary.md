# Summary
Mention that OIQ method performance is also evaluated in fixed-width bucket sizes ([](section-internalizing-experiment-3) and [](section-internalizing-experiment-4) in [publication X].

The benefit of population readability is partially maintained by selecting the discretization and interval predicate encoding

A good discretization algorithm ha s to balance the loss of information intrinsic to this kind of process and generating a reasonable number of cut  points, that is, a reasonable search space.
