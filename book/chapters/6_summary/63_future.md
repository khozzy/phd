# Future Works
The ideas presented in this thesis may be potentially developed in the following directions:

- Research on compacting the created population $[P]$. Current solution evolves a set of distinct classifiers representing fine-grained niches of search-space. An online process capable of merging neighbouring rules would have positive impact both on the overall performance and transparency.
- Investigation of agent's behaviour for non-stationary and non-deterministic environments. Problems like noise perception, of _concept drifting_ where the agent has to refine population of classifiers over time.
- Utilization of specific ALCS mechanism like _action planning_ to optimize process of building internal model of the real-valued environment. 
- Efficient way of tuning system parameters. ALCS comprise numerous amount of hyper-parameters, therefore a employing a heuristic process would contribute towards better performance.
